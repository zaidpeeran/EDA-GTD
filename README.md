Project Name -Global Terrorisim dataset analyzing
Project Type - EDA
Contribution - Individual
Project Summary -
In this project, I explored a dataset containing information about global terrorism acts since 1970, and attempted to make the findings as visual as possible. The dataset used is called the Global Terrorism Database available here, and contains over 100,000 terrorist incidents worldwide, with over 100 different attributes for each incident.

The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.
